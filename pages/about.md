# Alyssa Felix-Arreola

I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California in a neighborhood known as Boyle Heights. Boyle Heights is a passionate, dedicated and proud community that centers the values of community, culture and family and is something I hope reflects throughout my work. Growing up in Boyle Heights, a low-income and majority latine neighborhood, I experienced and witnessed, firsthand, the dispropotionate effect social, environmental and physcial factors played in harming the health and increasing health disparities in my community. Through my undergraduate education, as I completed my Bachelor's of Science in Global Health Studies, with a minor in GIS and Sustainability Science, I worked to be equipped with non-traditional and unique skills and tools to address social determinants of health that are harming low-income communities of color. In doing so, I continued my education as a candidate for the Masters of Urban Spatial Analytics Program at the Weitzman School of Design at the University of Pennsylvania.

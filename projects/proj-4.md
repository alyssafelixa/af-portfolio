## ArcGIS Experience and Projects

## Promotores de Salud: Using Spatial Analysis and Social Determinants of Health as a "Promotor de Salud" for Latine Community Health Interventions

In Fall 2022 and Spring 2024, as a 4th year student at the University of Southern California, I had the opportunity to work as a research assistant for John Wilson, director of the Spatial Science Institute. With my research partner, Junhong Duan and with the guidance of GIS Project Specialist, Beau MacDonald, we conducted a geospatial assessment of three indices and their components, and consider their potential to help evaluate the many social, environmental, and economic conditions that contribute to health inequities and disparate health outcomes within the ten-county region served by the Southern California Center for Chronic Health Disparities in Latino Families and Children (SCC-CHDLFC). Along with these three indices, our research also reviews state-mandated physical fitness assessments from local schools and include a geospatial vignette of an after-school lived experience in a Los Angeles neighborhood, This was envisioned in a ArcGIS Storymap in order to build the research enterprise as part of the Methods and Data Sub-Core for the new Center and emphasizes culturally-tailored health interventions for latine communities in Southern California.

## The Disproportionate Exposure of Air Pollution on Parks and Communities within Historically Redlined Neighborhoods in Proximity to Freeways

This is an ArcGIS Story map, submitted for Geospatial Technology Management for Sustainability Science, a upper-division course for Spatial Sciences, at the University of Southern California. In understanding the relationship between between freeways and parks/greenspaces, this project uses spatial analysis to understand environmental justice in relation to the disproportionate exposure of air pollution on parks and communities within historically redlined neighborhoods.

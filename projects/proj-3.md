## Assignments and Projects for Masters of Urban Spatial Analytics Courses

Within my first semester, Fall 2023, as a candidate of the Masters of Urban Spatial Analytics program I have had the opportunity to improve my spatial analytics skills, learning new coding languages such R and Python. These courses included Public Policy Analytics, Geospatial Data Science in Python and Statistical and Data Mining Methods for Urban Data Analysis(Spatial Statistics). As MUSA candidates are required to focus o  an urban content area focus, I completed courses related to public health including A Public Health Approach to Behavior Health and Methods to Public Health Practice. This page gives an insight to the assignments and projects completed in R and Python.
